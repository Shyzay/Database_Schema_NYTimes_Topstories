Implementation of the Data Definition Languages DDLs used to design this database for the Newyork Times Top Stories.



## Description



1. Create a database with any name of your choice for me, I created a 'nytimestopstories' database using the RDMS-MariaDB.

2. Have an IDE choice, run the python script which creates the database, for instance 'nytimestopstories'.

3. After creating the database, comment out the code line and run the script again in order to create the tables and also to insert values into the tables.

4. View the table dump by opeining the 'nytimestopstoriesdump.sql' file.


**Boom!!** Your database with some sample data inserted in it have been created


**Python** and **MariaDB** was used for this illustration.
